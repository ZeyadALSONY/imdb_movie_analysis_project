## Project Overview
---
This project aims to help a film production company develop a successful movie by analyzing IMDB movie data. The analysis will examine various factors contributing to film success.


## Data Sources

IMDB Movie Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "IMDB Movie ANALYSIS.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about various movies. 

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
- Success Definition: A film is considered successful if its profit is greater than its budget.

## Direct KPIs
- Director Name: Analyzing the directors of successful films to identify any commonalities or notable patterns.
- Actor Name: Studying the actors in successful films to understand their impact on a film's success.

## Data Cleaning

plot_keywords

 #### 4. Creation of "Success or Failure" Column
- Action: Added a calculated column named "Success or Failure".
- Formula: =IF([@gross] > [@budget], "Success", "Failure")
- Purpose: This column was created to categorize films based on their financial performance. If a film's gross revenue is greater than its budget, it is labeled as "Success"; otherwise, it is labeled as "Failure".

To identify patterns and factors contributing to the success of films, I created three pivot tables to analyze the data from different perspectives:
Success or Failure	Success
